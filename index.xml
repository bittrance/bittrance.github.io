In the first blog post we created a simple pipeline that ran our frontend tests. In this blog post we will show how to set up pods to support our tests. This also serves as a sketch of how to interact with Kubernetes in general.</description></item><item><title>Creating a simple build pipeline with Tekton</title><link>https://bittrance.github.io/posts/simple-pipeline-with-tekton/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 21:48:09 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://bittrance.github.io/posts/simple-pipeline-with-tekton/</guid><description>Tekton is a continuous integration and delivery platform on top of Kubernetes.

Kind uses Docker containers to represent nodes. Unlike minikube, this one boots up in less than a minute and can easily be extended with additional pretend nodes, making it superior for working with distributed applications.
There are several ways to install kind. If you are a Go developer, the easiest way may be to</description></item><item><title>Truncating a Kafka topic</title><link>https://bittrance.github.io/posts/kafka-purge-topic/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Apr 2021 20:43:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://bittrance.github.io/posts/kafka-purge-topic/</guid><description>Sometimes, you want to get rid of messages from a Kafka topic.
